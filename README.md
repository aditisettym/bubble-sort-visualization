# Bubble Sort Visualization in C

## Introduction
This project is a C program that visually demonstrates the Bubble Sort algorithm. The program generates a random array of integers, sorts the array using Bubble Sort, and provides a step-by-step visualization of the sorting process with a delay to create an animation effect.

## Features
- Generates a random array of integers
- Implements Bubble Sort with a delay to visualize the sorting process
- Highlights the elements being swapped in red
- Displays the original, sorting steps, and the sorted array

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Libraries**: `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<time.h>`

## Installation
To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bubble-sort-visualization.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd bubble-sort-visualization
    ```

3. **Compile the program**:
    ```sh
    gcc -o bubble_sort_visualization bubble_sort_visualization.c
    ```

4. **Run the program**:
    ```sh
    ./bubble_sort_visualization
    ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Program**:
    - Execute the compiled binary to start the program.
    
2. **Observe the Output**:
    - The program will display the original array, sorting steps, and the final sorted array.
    - During the sorting process, the elements being swapped are highlighted in red, creating an animation effect.
